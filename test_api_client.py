    test_text = "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Maureen is tracking her quiz scores' mean. The problem says that if she scores an 11 on the next quiz, her mean will increase by 1. Also, if she scores an 11 on each of the next three quizzes, her mean will increase by 2. We need to find her current mean. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, let me recall what mean is. The mean is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores. So, if she has some current scores, let's denote the current number of quizzes as, say, n, and the current total sum of scores as S. Then her current mean is S/n.\n\nNow, the first scenario: if she scores an 11 on the next quiz, her mean increases by 1. Let me write that down.\n\nAfter scoring an 11 on the next quiz, the total sum becomes S + 11, and the number of quizzes becomes n + 1. The new mean is (S + 11)/(n + 1). According to the problem, this new mean is equal to her current mean plus 1. So:\n\n(S + 11)/(n + 1) = S/n + 1\n\nOkay, that's one equation. Let's note that down.\n\nSecond scenario: if she scores 11 on each of the next three quizzes, her mean will increase by 2. So, after three quizzes, the total sum is S + 11*3 = S + 33, and the number of quizzes is n + 3. The new mean is (S + 33)/(n + 3). According to the problem, this is equal to her current mean plus 2:\n\n(S + 33)/(n + 3) = S/n + 2\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1) (S + 11)/(n + 1) = S/n + 1\n\n2) (S + 33)/(n + 3) = S/n + 2\n\nSo, we need to solve these two equations for S and n. Then, once we have those, we can find the current mean S/n.\n\nLet me try solving the first equation first.\n\nStarting with equation 1:\n\n(S + 11)/(n + 1) = S/n + 1\n\nLet me multiply both sides by n(n + 1) to eliminate denominators.\n\nn(S + 11) = (S/n + 1) * n(n + 1)\n\nWait, maybe better to first subtract S/n + 1 from both sides and then combine terms. Alternatively, cross multiply.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n(S + 11)/(n + 1) - S/n = 1\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n[ (S + 11) * n - S(n + 1) ] / [n(n + 1)] = 1\n\nExpanding numerator:\n\n(Sn + 11n - Sn - S) / [n(n + 1)] = 1\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nSn cancels with -Sn, so left with 11n - S.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(11n - S)/[n(n + 1)] = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by n(n + 1):\n\n11n - S = n(n + 1)\n\nSo:\n\n11n - S = n¬≤ + n\n\nRearranged:\n\nS = 11n - n¬≤ - n = 10n - n¬≤\n\nSo S = -n¬≤ + 10n\n\nSo that's equation 1. Let me write that.\n\nNow, moving to equation 2:\n\n(S + 33)/(n + 3) = S/n + 2\n\nAgain, let's do similar steps.\n\nFirst, subtract S/n + 2 from both sides:\n\n(S + 33)/(n + 3) - S/n - 2 = 0\n\nAlternatively, let's rearrange:\n\n(S + 33)/(n + 3) = S/n + 2\n\nMultiply both sides by n(n + 3):\n\nn(S + 33) = (S/n + 2) * n(n + 3)\n\nWait, similar to before, maybe better to compute the left side minus the right side equals zero.\n\nAlternatively, let's do:\n\n(S + 33)/(n + 3) - S/n = 2\n\nCompute the left side:\n\n[ (S + 33)n - S(n + 3) ] / [n(n + 3)] = 2\n\nExpanding numerator:\n\nSn + 33n - Sn - 3S = 33n - 3S\n\nTherefore:\n\n(33n - 3S)/[n(n + 3)] = 2\n\nMultiply both sides by n(n + 3):\n\n33n - 3S = 2n(n + 3)\n\nSimplify right side: 2n¬≤ + 6n\n\nSo:\n\n33n - 3S = 2n¬≤ + 6n\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n-3S = 2n¬≤ + 6n - 33n\n\nWhich is:\n\n-3S = 2n¬≤ - 27n\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n3S = -2n¬≤ + 27n\n\nTherefore:\n\nS = (-2n¬≤ + 27n)/3 = (-2/3)n¬≤ + 9n\n\nSo now we have two expressions for S:\n\nFrom equation 1: S = -n¬≤ + 10n\n\nFrom equation 2: S = (-2/3)n¬≤ + 9n\n\nSet them equal:\n\n-n¬≤ + 10n = (-2/3)n¬≤ + 9n\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\n-n¬≤ + 10n + (2/3)n¬≤ - 9n = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-n¬≤ + (2/3)n¬≤) + (10n - 9n) = 0\n\nCalculating coefficients:\n\n(-1 + 2/3) n¬≤ + 1n = 0 => (-1/3)n¬≤ + n = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate fraction:\n\n- n¬≤ + 3n = 0\n\nSo:\n\n- n¬≤ + 3n = 0 => n¬≤ - 3n = 0 => n(n - 3) = 0\n\nTherefore, n = 0 or n = 3.\n\nBut n is the number of quizzes Maureen has taken so far. It can't be 0 because she has taken some quizzes already. So n = 3.\n\nSo the current number of quizzes is 3. Then, we can find S from equation 1: S = -n¬≤ + 10n.\n\nPlugging in n = 3:\n\nS = - (3)^2 + 10*3 = -9 + 30 = 21.\n\nSo the total current sum of scores is 21, and the number of quizzes is 3. Therefore, the current mean is 21 / 3 = 7.\n\nWait, so is the answer 7? Let me check if that works with both equations.\n\nFirst check equation 1: if she scores 11 on the next quiz, the new total is 21 + 11 = 32, and the number of quizzes is 4. The new mean is 32 / 4 = 8. Current mean is 7, so increase by 1. That works.\n\nNow equation 2: if she scores 11 on each of the next three quizzes, total becomes 21 + 3*11 = 21 + 33 = 54. Number of quizzes is 3 + 3 = 6. New mean is 54 / 6 = 9. Current mean was 7, so increase by 2. That also works. Perfect.\n\nSo the current mean is 7. So the answer is 7.\n\nBut let me just make sure there are no other possible solutions. We had n(n - 3) = 0. n = 0 is invalid, so only n = 3. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the mean of her quiz scores currently is 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe mean of her quiz scores currently is \\boxed{7}.\n$$. Time is up. I should stop thinking and now write a summary containing all key steps required to solve the problem.</think>"
